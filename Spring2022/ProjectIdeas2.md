I don't have any specific ideas yet, I just know I want to work on something with Javascript, I think. Probably a Node.js module

## Nishant Srivastava

I want to work on a screen capturing software that allows users to share their content with each other with privacy controls. This idea is to replicate Streamable, NVIDIA's GeForce Experience tool, ShareX, and Lightshot.

## Christy Yoo

I'm not fully sure what I'll be doing yet, but I've been interested in the Magenta open source project that's built upon TensorFlow. It uses machine learning to train machine learning models using data and creating various forms of art.

## Elise Kulka

I would be interested in working on a project that improves efficiency. For example, I like [Gerrit Code Review](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) because the efficiency of code reviews is improved by allowing users to hold code reviews inside a Git repository. Something similar might be interesting to work on.

## Alexandre Fernandez

I think some projects I would be interested in would include some element of cryptography and computing. I am interested in more practical applications or libraries. I think a blessed repository structure seems appealing to me.

## Anthony Jin

I would probably work on something I've been working on in RCOS called OED (Open Energy Dashboard). If there is an interesting project that gets presented, I might choose those projects instead. Preferably something web-development oriented, though it would be fun to learn languages for mobile apps or games.

## Jonathon Koseoglu

I was interested in creating a platform for RPI athletes to log workouts and track PRs to compare to other athletes. Coaches could also release workout plans through it which would be beneficial for mass communication during offseason and for coaches to track progress.
